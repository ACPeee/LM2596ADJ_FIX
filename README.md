# LM2596ADJ_FIX
In this connection,ı prefer using LM2576-5V and LM2576 ADJ regulations and ı want take 5V from LM2576-5V regulator and ı want take 7.5V from LM2576-ADJ regulator.Everyone use at the ADJ circuit a potanciometer.I prefer using resistor and ı want a constant 7.5V.R3 and R4 voltage setting like that:V_out = 1.23x(1+(R3/R4))
